Weighted Quick Union Path Compression is best.
The idea of path compression is to make the found root as parent of x so that we don’t have to traverse all intermediate nodes again.
The two techniques  weighted quick-union and weighted quick-union path compression complement each other.
The time complexity of each operation becomes even smaller in path compression.
